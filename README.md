# LeArmSimulator
Digital simulator for HiWonder's LeArm mechanical arm I created to help test the code without interacting with the arm every time.

You can install Processing 4.3.x and run the source code or unzip and run the exe by itself: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/uu9v36cp9sn5k3lzxm8nv/LeArm-Sim-Application.zip?rlkey=qnf7me0m2d3ppfbhl2njfgo0b&st=uh5w3fl9&dl=0

Instructions:
Click on the text in the boxes on the bottom right to edit the servo rotation numbers. Click enter or click off to de-focus them. 
Press H to move arm to the servo locations listed on the bottom right.
