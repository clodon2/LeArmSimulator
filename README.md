# LeArmSimulator
Digital simulator for HiWonder's LeArm mechanical arm I created to help test the code without interacting with the arm every time.

Instructions:
Click on the text in the boxes on the bottom right to edit the servo rotation numbers. Click enter or click off to de-focus them. 
Press H to move arm to the servo locations listed on the bottom right.
